    <h2>About Page</h2>
    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
        to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin II Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in
                his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug,
                in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle
                of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's
                East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on
                the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.</p>

            <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
            <p>Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also
                nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing
                feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.</p>

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
                Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin
                Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing
                a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the
                Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company,
                as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and
                later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the
                company of Thorin.</p>

            <h3>Glóin</h3>
            <p>Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and
                younger brother of Óin.
                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of
                the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.
                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
                March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin
                to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin
                referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling
                distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".</p>

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger
                brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely
                Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the
                Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA
                2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely
                Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.</p>

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
            <p>Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

                Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left
                the Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In
                TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood
                from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin
                to inform him the news.</p>

            <h3>Ori</h3>
            <p>Ori lived in Thorin's hall in the northern Blue Mountains for many years, alongside his cousins: Dori and
                Nori. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf,
                Bilbo Baggins, and the other Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of
                Smaug. Finally, he and the other Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies in TA
                2942, which he survived.</p>

                In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with

                and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced
                to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a
                new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.</p>

                line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it
                fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen
                "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA
                2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to
                the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

            <h3>Bilbo Baggins</h3>
            <p>Bilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 12-14 of our calendar), in
                the year 2890 of the Third Age. He was the only son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took.

                In Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious Hobbit-hole for Belladonna, which they
                named Bag End. The family moved to their new home, where Bilbo would spend much of his life.
                As a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside world. The Istar wizard, Gandalf,
                took interest in this unusual quality in Bilbo during his visits to the Shire. Bilbo would later
                remember Gandalf's fireworks in the dwelling of his mother's family at Great Smials. Bilbo apparently
                practiced his rock-throwing skills in his youth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever
                he bent down to pick up a rock.

                When Bilbo's father and mother died in TA 2926 and TA 2934 respectively, Bilbo became his own master and
                spent the next seven years living alone in Bag End. During this time, Bilbo grew fond of his life as a
                wealthy bachelor and acquired a reputation for respectability that the neighbors admired.</p>

            <h3>Gandalf</h3>
            <p>Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by Ilúvatar before
                the Music of the Ainur[1], and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.[2] In
                his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with
                light and fire, much like Varda[3], yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and
                patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them
                fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of
                Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him
                out of despair.</p>
